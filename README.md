# Ruby WebSockets Chat Demo

This started out as a simple application to demonstrate web sockets, but has developed into a demonstration of some basic HTML5 features (web sockets, geolocation, localStorage). 

The main purpose of this apllication is to demo in ILT. It includes no security features (such as AuthN/AuthZ) and some of the basic security features have been commented out for demonstration purposes (more secure lines are just above)
